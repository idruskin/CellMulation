# AI Final Project: Cell Simulation  (CellMulation)

## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

We want to create a way to simulate and visualize various interactions between different search agents. Search agents will be modeled loosely on immune and pathogen cells, but we can expand into more interesting behaviors based on other cell organisms or our imaginations.

Modeling how our immune cells search and destroy pathogens through some sort of game we will create. 

 - Make on a small scale how immune cells search and attack pathogens
 - Cells could be represented as nodes on a graph and we could implement some search algorithm we’ve already learned (to start off simple - BFS/DFS etc)
 - More complex representations of cells that influence search could be implemented once the simplest version works.


## IDEAL OUTCOME OF PROJECT:

 - A simulation environment where active agents such as immune cells and pathogens can be shown interacting in a sandbox (tweakable parameters: variable agents, duration of the simulation, and starting positions)
 - A visualization of the simulation environment.
 - A functioning game that models how our immune cells search and destroy pathogens
 - An ML component where the pathogen seeking cells learn how to find and destroy the pathogens through a self-play learning process.

## EXTENSION IDEAS IDENTIFIED:

 - Add additional/complex agents
 - Make simulation more of a game.  Ideas for gamifying
 - Levels with some goal to be accomplished by placing agents in specific locations
 - Create “balanced” ecosystem of agents
 - User controls an agent during simulation
 - Automatic generation of simulated ecosystems
 - More modes of interaction/customization
 - Better graphics
 - If we’re implementing the idea on an open plane, collision detection with bounds on the shape of the blobs instead of rectangular hit boxes could be something cool to implement too.
